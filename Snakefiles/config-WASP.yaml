# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and

# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.

# The path to a text file specifying where to find read information for each sample.
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 4 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <1000genomes_id> <unique_sample_id> <fastq1_rna_path> <fastq2_rna_path>
