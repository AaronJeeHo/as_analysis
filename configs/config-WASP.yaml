# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the allele specific analysis pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# All config options are required unless noted otherwise.

# The path to a text file specifying where to find read information for each sample.
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 5 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <vcf_sample_id> <unique_sample_name> <dna_bam_path> <fastq1_rna_path> <fastq2_rna_path>
# Or if you don't have a BAM file, you can leave it out to perform a more
# conservative version of the ASE test (see the 'rna_only' config below)

# Text file containing names and lengths of all chromosomes in the assembly. chromInfo.txt files can be downloaded from the UCSC genome browser.

# If the <dna_bam_path> column is left out in the sample file, or if you set
# the rna_only option below to true, the pipeline will default to running the
# rna-only version of the analysis, in which DNA read counts are ignored. This
# performs a more conservative test.

# Gene annotation information in the GTF format. These can usually be obtained from GENCODE
# You should provide the same one that you used when creating the STAR index
# For example, a gencode.v19.genes.chr.gtf file for hg19 can be downloaded from https://www.gencodegenes.org/releases/19.html

# If you have downloaded WASP from https://github.com/bmvdgeijn/WASP, specify the path to your WASP directory here

# When this option is not provided, the pipeline will install WASP in your .snakemake directory
