# This is the Snakemake configuration file that specifies paths and 
# and options for the allele specific analysis pipeline. Anybody wishing to use
# the provided snakemake pipeline should first fill out this file with paths to
# their own data, as the Snakefile requires it.
# All config options are required unless noted otherwise.

# if True, analyze ATAC-seq data
"asoc": false


# The path to a text file specifying where to find sorted BAM files for each sample.
# Each row in the sample file should represent a different sample.
# The sample file should have 4 columns (each separated by a single tab):
#       <vcf_sample_id> <unique_sample_name> <dna_bam_path> <rna_bam_path>
# if asoc: true, sample file should have 5 columns:
#   <vcf_sample_id> <unique_sample_name> <dna_bam_path> <atac_bam_path> <sample_peaks_bed_path>
# dna_bam_path column can be omitted if rna_only set to true (below)
"sample_file" : "data/samples.tsv"

# If the <dna_bam_path> column is left out in the sample file, or if you set
# the rna_only option below to true, the pipeline will default to running the
# rna-only version of the analysis, in which DNA read counts are ignored. This
# performs a more conservative test.
"rna_only" : true

# If your RNA-seq data is single-end instead of paired-end, set this config
# to true. In that case, you can provide only one FASTQ file in each line of
# the samples file above. Otherwise, if this option is set to a false value
# or commented out, both FASTQs will be used.
"unpaired": true

# The path to a reference genome
# This is not required if "ref_genome_star" is provided below
# Note: the FASTA file should not be gzipped
"ref_genome" : "data/rn6.fa"

# The path to a STAR index directory for "ref_genome"
# If "ref_genome" is provided but not this, the pipeline will create the index
# on the fly
# "ref_genome_star" : "data/star_index"

# Text file containing names and lengths of all chromosomes in the assembly. chromInfo.txt files can be downloaded from the UCSC genome browser.
# For example a chromInfo.txt.gz file for hg19 can be downloaded from http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/chromInfo.txt.gz
# Make sure that the presence/absence of a chr prefix in this file matches what you have in your VCF (and your snp_h5_dir files if provided)!
"chrom_info" : "data/rn6.chrom.sizes"

# Gene annotation information in the GTF format.
# These can usually be obtained from GENCODE (https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/)
# under the "PRI" regions label
# You can also obtain them from the UCSC server using these instructions:
# https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQgenes.html#gtfDownload
# If you provided a STAR index directory in 'ref_genome_star' above, you should
# provide the same gtf that you used to create that index
# Note: the GTF file should not be gzipped

# If you have downloaded WASP from https://github.com/bmvdgeijn/WASP, specify the path to your WASP directory here
# Otherwise, specify the location of the directory in which you'd like it installed
# When this option is not provided, the pipeline will install WASP in your .snakemake directory
"wasp_dir" : "/iblm/netapp/home/jezhou/WASP"

# You can substitute ATAC-seq data for RNA-seq data!
# Just set this config option to "true", so that the pipeline uses BWA instead of STAR
# Also, you must provide a BWA-indexed reference genome via the "ref_genome" option (see above)
# This option will default to false if not provided
"asoc": false

# defined relative to whatever directory you execute the snakemake command in
# "output_dir" : "asoc_out"

# A VCF file with which to run WASP. This can come from the variant calling pipeline
# The VCF must be gzipped and tabix-indexed (with a .tbi index in the same dir)
# It must also contain genotype quality (GQ) information. Otherwise, you must set
# a default in "default_gq" below
"vcf_file" : "data/hs_1536_beagle_AWS_Jessica_RFIDs_12102020.vcf.gz"

# Set this option to a default GQ value if your VCF lacks GQ information. This default
# will be used for all variant records. We recommend a default of 20, which will
# generally lead to a more conservative test for allele-specific expression than
# if the VCF had GQ tags
# If this option is commented out or set to a falsey value, the pipeline will assume
# GQ tags exist in the VCF you provided
"default_gq": 20

# If you already have SNP HDF5 files, specify the directory of the files here
# Otherwise, they will be created in this location
# When this option is not provided, the pipeline will use {output_dir}/genotypes/snp_h5
# Make sure that the presence/absence of a chr prefix in your chrom_info file match those in the h5 files!
# "snp_h5_dir" : "out/genotypes/snp_h5"

# For internal use.
